About my awesome project:
- On this project, I made a website for freelancing job fetching. 
- From there, anyone can add his company's job and bid for others posted job.
- Any job owner can add his job by filling a form and save this on the database. On the contrary, he can see his added job on the My Job route.
- Any Job holder can bid others company's job by filling a form and also store it on the database.
- A job owner can update or delete his posted job.
- All of the route (without home page) are private route.
- For login information, I use the Json Web Token for verify the user.
- Also there are some status functionality for job owner and job holder.
